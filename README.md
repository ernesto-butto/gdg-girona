## Resources

### Python


- [Google Colab Notebooks](https://colab.research.google.com): This is the fastest enviroment to start playing with python and machine learning, no need to install anything. If a library is not availble, to install it just do `!pip install x`

- [Python Programming Fun Video Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLi01XoE8jYohWFPpC17Z-wWhPOSuh8Er-): Socratica makes it easy and fun!

- [Panda Introduction](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/mlcc/intro_to_pandas.ipynb?utm_source=mlcc&utm_campaign=colab-external&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=pandas-colab&hl=es-419): Ideal python library manipulating data in Machine Learning

- [Docker scikit learn](https://github.com/smizy/docker-scikit-learn): Simple docker jupyter notebook to run jupyter on the web

- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/): If you need to work on your computer, this library has all the datascience dependencies required

### Machine Learning
- [Simple Machine Learning Recepies](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOU2XLYxmsIIuiBfYad6rFYQU_jL2ryal): Easy to follow short recepies you can follow and test most of it on Google Colab.

- [Googles crash course and more in depth videos](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/):
- [Fast A.I](http://course.fast.ai/): World class deep learning free course. If you can code you can learn deep learning
- [Data Camp Supervised Learning Course](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/supervised-learning-with-scikit-learn): Learn step by step using an interactive platform


## Meetup 1 - Machine Learning Study Jam - #1 - Saturday, July 14th 2018
Meetup link: https://www.meetup.com/es-ES/GDG-Girona/events/251945220/

### Summary

It lasted 4 hours + after beers.

We worked through half of the **ML concepts** course recommended by google: https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/

We learned a lot, everyone contributed to the experience, we ate snacks and got to know each other :)

## Meetup 2 - Machine Learning Study Jam - #2 - Saturday, July 21 2018
Meetup link:  https://www.meetup.com/es-ES/GDG-Girona/events/252838700/

### Summary

We finished the pending excersices and minimum work required by Google to complete the study jam.

## Meetup 3 - Saturday, September 22 2018

After talking to Google's Machine Learning community, and based on their recommendations, we decided to stop the Tensor Flow path for a moment, and pickup other more simpler paths and technnologies to make it easier for everyone.
Thus we focused on this set of short Google excersices:

We are working our way up in complexity :)
